# This YAML file is a configuration file for sqlc, a tool that generates type-safe Go code from SQL queries.
# Specifies the configuration version for sqlc.
# Defines the SQL source files for code generation:
# schema: "sql/schema" → The directory containing database schema files (.sql files with CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, etc.).
# queries: "sql/queries" → The directory containing SQL queries (.sql files with SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
# engine: "postgresql" → Specifies PostgreSQL as the database engine.
# Generates Go code from SQL queries and saves it in the internal/database/ directory.
# When you run:

# sqlc generate

# sqlc reads schema files from sql/schema/ and query files from sql/queries/.
# It generates Go structs and methods for executing the queries.
# The generated code is stored in internal/database/.
